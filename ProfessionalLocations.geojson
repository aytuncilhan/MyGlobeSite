Being the COO of a high-tech start-up, N.D. has always been a great mentor and source of inspiration for me. Not only she has always encouraged me to push my limits and grow in multiple domains, but also has put her trust in and stood by me - just like a true leader. Albeit, I must admit, it is a bit ironic that right after Solvoyo, I started my internship at NATO while trying to internalize the motto that starts <q><i>it does not take an <b>army</b>...</i></q>",
