Being the COO of a high-tech start-up, N.D. has always been a great mentor and source of inspiration for me. Not only she has always encouraged me to push my limits and grow in multiple domains, but also has put her trust in me and stood by me whenever I needed - just like a true leader. Albeit, I must admit, it’s a bit ironic that I started my journey at NATO while trying to internalize a motto that states <i>it doesn’t take an <b>army</b></i>",
