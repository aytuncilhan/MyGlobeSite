Though there has been sleeples nights in those labs throughout four years of my Bachelors degree, the feeling when I received my Bachelor of Science degree is indescribable. Graduating with an honors degree was of course a source of joy and satisfaction, <i>but more, much more than this I did it my way!</i>",
