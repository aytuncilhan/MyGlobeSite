Here, having spent more than 2 years, I had the chance to work on unique software projects, with amazing people embracing the diversity in this multinational civil-military joint environment. <br> Currently, as the project lead on a digital transformation project at the second largest division in the Headquarters, I develop the high-level business strategy, engage with stakeholders, collaborate with team on the implementation, and ensure organizational change is well integrated.",

Not only she has always encouraged me to push my limits and grow in multiple domains, but also has put her trust in me and stood by me just like a true leader. I have to mention though, it is ironic for me to join NATO having mentioned the good old  ''It does not take an <b>army</b>!'' motto - but maybe it is true after all, instead of one, it takes <a href='https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/nato_countries.htm'>thirty of them</a>!",
