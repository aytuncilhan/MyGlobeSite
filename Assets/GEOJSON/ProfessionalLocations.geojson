Not only she has always encouraged me to push my limits and grow in multiple domains, but also has put her trust in me and stood by me just like a true leader. Albeit, it's ironic to join NATO given the  ''It does not take an <b>army</b>!'' Maybe it's true though, instead of one, it takes <a href='https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/nato_countries.htm'>thirty of them</a>!",
